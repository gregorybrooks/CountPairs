12	tutor ##ial : introduction to rest ##ora ##tive justice . rest ##ora ##tive justice is a theory of justice that emphasizes repairing the harm caused by criminal behaviour . it is best accomplished through cooperative processes that include all stakeholders . this can lead to transformation of people , relationships and communities . practices and programs reflecting rest ##ora ##tive purposes will respond to crime by : 1 identifying and taking steps to repair harm , 2 involving all stakeholders , and . 3 transforming the traditional relationship between communities and their governments in responding to crime .
13	organize volunteer community panels , boards , or committees that meet with the offender to discuss the incident and offender obligation to repair the harm to victims and community members . facilitate the process of apologies to victims and communities . invite local victim advocates to provide ongoing victim - awareness training for probation staff .
14	the purpose of this paper is to point out a number of un ##res ##olved issues in the criminal justice system , present the underlying principles of rest ##ora ##tive justice , and then to review the growing amount of empirical data on victim - offender mediation .
15	each of these types of communities ##ath ##e geographic community of the victim , offender , or crime ; the community of care ; and civil society ##ama ##y be injured by crime in different ways and degrees , but all will be affected in common ways as well : the sense of safety and confidence of their members is threatened , order within the community is threatened , and ( depending on the kind of crime ) common values of the community are challenged and perhaps eroded .
16	the approach is based on a theory of justice that considers crime and wrong ##do ##ing to be an offense against an individual or community , rather than the state . rest ##ora ##tive justice that foster ##s dialogue between victim and offender has shown the highest rates of victim satisfaction and offender accountability .
17	inherent in many people ##as understanding of the notion of ad ##r is the existence of a dispute between identifiable parties . criminal justice , however , is not usually conceptual ##ised as a dispute between victim and offender , but is instead seen as a matter concerning the relationship between the offender and the state . this raises a complex question as to whether a criminal offence can properly be described as a adi ##sp ##ute ##a .

29	at this time the industrial workers of the world had a membership of over 100 , 000 members . in 1913 william hay ##wood replaced vincent saint john as secretary - treasurer of the industrial workers of the world . by this time , the i ##w ##w had 100 , 000 members .
30	this was not true of the industrial workers of the world and as a result many of its members were first and second generation immigrants . several immigrants such as mary ' mother ' jones , hubert harrison , carlo tres ##ca , arturo giovanni ##tti and joe ha ##ag ##lund hill became leaders of the organization .
31	chinese immigration and the chinese exclusion acts . in the 1850s , chinese workers migrated to the united states , first to work in the gold mines , but also to take agricultural jobs , and factory work , especially in the garment industry .
32	the rise of industrial america , 1877 - 1900 . when in 1873 mark twain and charles dudley warner entitled their co - authored novel the gilded age , they gave the late nineteenth century its popular name . the term reflected the combination of outward wealth and da ##zzle with inner corruption and poverty .
33	american objections to chinese immigration took many forms , and generally stemmed from economic and cultural tensions , as well as ethnic discrimination . most chinese laborers who came to the united states did so in order to send money back to china to support their families there .
34	the rise of industrial america , the dominance of wage labor , and the growth of cities represented perhaps the greatest changes of the period . few americans at the end of the civil war had anticipated the rapid rise of american industry .
35	the resulting angel ##l treaty permitted the united states to restrict , but not completely prohibit , chinese immigration . in 1882 , congress passed the chinese exclusion act , which , per the terms of the angel ##l treaty , suspended the immigration of chinese laborers ( skilled or un ##ski ##lled ) for a period of 10 years .
36	industrial workers of the world . in 1905 representatives of 43 groups who opposed the policies of american federation of labour , formed the radical labour organisation , the industrial workers of the world ( i ##w ##w ) . the i ##w ##w ' s goal was to promote worker solidarity in the revolutionary struggle to overthrow the employing class .
37	the railroads powered the industrial economy . they consumed the majority of iron and steel produced in the united states before 1890 . as late as 1882 , steel rails accounted for 90 percent of the steel production in the united states . they were the nation ##as largest consumer of lumber and a major consumer of coal .
38	this finally resulted in legislation that aimed to limit future immigration of chinese workers to the united states , and threatened to sour diplomatic relations between the united states and china .

49	color ##aur ##ine can be a variety of colors , most often shades of yellow , from very pale or color ##less to very dark or amber . unusual or abnormal urine colors can be the result of a disease process , several medications ( e . g . , multi ##vita ##mins can turn urine bright yellow ) , or the result of eating certain foods .
50	i had 3 cups of coffee and a red bull today all in 4 hours . the first time i ur ##inated , it was an amber color . then i got worried and drank a lot of water and now my urine is back to normal ( light yellow ) . this only happened once after drinking all that caf ##fe ##ine . related topics : coffee , ur ##ination , drinking , caf ##fe ##ine .
51	during the visual examination of the urine , the labor ##ator ##ian observes the urine ' s color and clarity . these can be signs of what substances may be present in the urine . they are interpreted in conjunction with results obtained during the chemical and microscopic examinations to confirm what substances are present .
52	but the basic details of your urine - - color , smell , and how often you go - - can give you a hint about what ##as going on inside your body . pee is your body ##as liquid waste , mainly made of water , salt , and chemicals called ur ##ea and ur ##ic acid . your kidney ##s make it when they filter toxin ##s and other bad stuff from your blood .
53	however , red - colored urine can also occur when blood is present in the urine and can be an indicator of disease or damage to some part of the ur ##ina ##ry system . another example is yellow - brown or greenish - brown urine that may be a sign of bi ##li ##ru ##bin in the urine ( see the chemical examination section ) .
54	the shade , light or dark , also changes . if it has no color at all , that may be because you ##ave been drinking a lot of water or taking a drug called a di ##ure ##tic , which helps your body get rid of fluid . very dark honey - or brown - colored urine could be a sign that you ##are de ##hy ##dra ##ted and need to get more fluids right away .
55	a good rule of thumb is the darker your urine , the more water you need to drink . and if your urine is any other color besides a various shade of yellow ( which we ##all get into down below ) something may be wrong .
56	color , density , and smell can reveal health problems . human urine has been a useful tool of diagnosis since the earliest days of medicine . the color , density , and smell of urine can reveal much about the state of our health . here , for starters , are some of the things you can tell from the hue of your liquid ex ##cre ##ta . advertising policy .

62	primary bi ##lia ##ry ci ##rr ##hosis , or p ##bc , is a chronic , or long - term , disease of the liver that slowly destroys the medium - sized bile duct ##s within the liver . bile is a digest ##ive liquid that is made in the liver . it travels through the bile duct ##s to the small int ##est ##ine , where it helps digest fat ##s and fatty vitamin ##s . in patients with p ##bc , the bile duct ##s are destroyed by inflammation . this causes bile to remain in the liver , where gradual injury damages liver cells and causes ci ##rr ##hosis , or scar ##ring of the liver . as ci ##rr ##hosis progresses and the amount of scar tissue in the liver increases , the liver loses its ability to function . t travels through the bile duct ##s to the small int ##est ##ine , where it helps digest fat ##s and fatty vitamin ##s . in patients with p ##bc , the bile duct ##s are destroyed by inflammation . this causes bile to remain in the liver , where gradual injury damages liver cells and causes ci ##rr ##hosis , or scar ##ring of the liver .

69	however , a major motive with people today wanting to use the barley harvest to determine the start of the year is to justify starting the year as early as possible , frequently even before the end of winter . that is in fact the opposite of what the talmud records the leaders of the san ##hed ##rin occasionally doing . . .
70	some people claim that the timing of the barley harvest in israel should be the deciding factor as to when to start the new year for determining the ob ##ser ##vance of god ' s annual feast ##s and holy days .
71	barley ( horde ##um vulgar ##e l . ) , a member of the grass family , is a major cereal grain . it was one of the first cultivated grains and is now grown widely . barley grain is a staple in tibetan cuisine and was eaten widely by peasants in medieval europe . barley has also been used as animal f ##od ##der , as a source of fe ##rm ##ent ##able material for beer and certain di ##sti ##lled beverages , and as a component of various health foods .
72	the state of the barley harvest could perhaps cause the start of a year to be postponed to the following new moon ( thereby giving the previous year a 13th month ) , but the state of the barley harvest could never determine that an earlier new moon should be used to start the year !
73	the grape harvest was usually completed before tab ##ern ##acle ##s , but most of the olive harvest came after the autumn festivals . in ancient israel the primary harvest season extended from april to november . this harvest period might be subdivided into three seasons and three major crops : the spring grain harvest , the summer grape harvest and the autumn olive harvest .
74	barley is not as cold tolerant as the winter wheat ##s ( tri ##tic ##um ae ##sti ##vu ##m ) , fall rye ( sec ##ale cereal ##e ) or winter tri ##tical ##e ( a tri ##tic ##ose ##cal ##e wit ##tm . ex a . cam ##us . ) , but may be so ##wn as a winter crop in warmer areas of australia and great britain . barley has a short growing season and is also relatively drought tolerant .
75	aw ##hea ##t ripe ##ns later than barley and , according to the ge ##zer manual , was harvested during the sixth agricultural season , y ##rh q ##sr w ##k ##l ( end of april to end of may ) a ( page 88 ; also see the chart on page 37 of bo ##row ##ski ##as book , reproduced below ) .
76	that claim is obviously not correct . god did not hi ##nge the start of a new year on the state of the barley crop , even if on occasions in the first and second centuries a . d . the ph ##aris ##ai ##cal leaders of the san ##hed ##rin in jerusalem decided to use the state of the barley harvest to start a new year one new moon later .
77	barley is always so ##wn in the autumn , after the early rains , and the barley harvest , which for any given locality pre ##cede ##s the wheat harvest ( exodus 9 : 31 f ) , begins near jericho in april - - or even march - - but in the hill country of palestine is not concluded until the end of may or beginning of june .
78	pen ##tec ##ost , near the end of the grain harvest , included grain and loaf offerings ( verses 16 - 17 ) . pen ##tec ##ost was also called at ##he feast of harvest ##a ( exodus 23 : 16 ) . barley and wheat were planted in the autumn and ripe ##ned in spring . barley mature ##d faster and would be harvested sooner . the first ##fr ##uit ##s of grain offered during the festival of un ##lea ##ven ##ed bread would have been barley .
79	there are however some very serious illnesses that can cause this pain in left side under ribs . these would include p ##ne ##um ##otho ##ra ##x , pan ##cre ##ati ##tis , and di ##sse ##ction of the abdominal ao ##rta . it could also be a sp ##leen disorder , kidney stones , or per ##ica ##rd ##rit ##is ( inflammation of the heart sac ) .
80	pan ##cre ##ati ##tis is an inflammation of the pan ##cre ##as and can be caused by eating very fatty foods . if the left side pain under ribs is caused by a di ##sse ##ction of the abdominal ao ##rta , your life is in immediate danger . dying from an internal hem ##or ##rh ##age is the major risk involved in this situation .
81	what organs are on your left side of body . causes of pain under left rib cage . here are just some of the possible reasons why you may be feeling pain under your left rib cage : gas stuck in the colon a there is a chance that you have gas stuck in your colon . the amount of gas that is stuck may be excessive .
82	for the individual bones , see rib . for ribs of animals as food , see ribs ( food ) . for other uses , see rib ( di ##sam ##bi ##gua ##tion ) . the rib cage is an arrangement of bones in the thor ##ax of all ve ##rte ##brates except the lamp ##rey and the frog . it is formed by the ve ##rte ##bra ##l column , ribs , and stern ##um and en ##cl ##oses the heart and lungs .
83	if the lower set of ribs on the right side of the rib cage get damaged due to an injury , then one is likely to experience a sharp pain under the right rib cage . if the pain worse ##ns when one tries to bend or twist the body , then an x - ray examination should be conducted to study the extent of damage to the ribs .
84	vital organs such as heart and lungs are protected by the rib cage . under the rib cage lie many organs that form a part of the abdomen . most of the organs that lie in the abdominal region are a part of the digest ##ive system . these include the liver , gall ##bla ##dder , kidney ##s , pan ##cre ##as , sp ##leen , stomach , small int ##est ##ine and the large int ##est ##ine .
85	the only organs contained in the chest cavity are the lungs and the heart . obviously , one of the lungs is under the left rib cage , and then the heart is also found here . the o ##a ##¦ ##nl ##y other part of the chest cavity to be noted would be the dia ##ph ##rag ##m , which aids a person ' s breathing . 4 people found this useful .
86	usually , you can feel the pain rev ##er ##ber ##ating from the upper portion of the left side of your abdomen towards the left side of your rib ##ca ##ge . irritation on the sp ##leen a there is a chance that your sp ##leen has already ru ##pt ##ured because of various reasons and this can cause some pains on the left rib cage .
87	each rib consists of a head , neck , and a shaft , and they are numbered from top to bottom . the head of rib is the end part closest to the spine with which it art ##iculate ##s . it is marked by a kidney - shaped art ##icular surface which is divided by a horizontal crest into two face ##ts .
88	with either of these there is a fairly simple medication treatment . there is also the possibility that gas is caught in the colon . this is even less serious that acid ref ##lux and does not require medication to resolve it . sharp pain left side under ribs might come from a condition called cost ##och ##ond ##rit ##is .
